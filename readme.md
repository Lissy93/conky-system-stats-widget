## About

[Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) is a free, light-weight system
monitor for X, that displays any kind of information on your desktop.
(for more information, see the [Conky Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki))

It is highly customisable through creating Configuration files, and this here is my
configuration file. It aims to be simple, minimal and lightweight, while still
clearly showing all your vital system stats at a glance.


## Installation

 1. Firstly, install Conky. For Ubuntu/ Debian-based distros, this can be done with
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install conky
    ```
    See the [official installation page](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Installation),
    for instructions for your distro.

 2. Set the config file to `minimal-system-conky.conf`. You can do this by running:
     ```
     conky --config /path/to/minimal-conky/minimal-terminal-conky.conf
     ```
 3. Make this permant, and start conky on system start:
  ```

  ```
